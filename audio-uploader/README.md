1. Import the audio-table.sql file into an existing or blank database
2. Edit CONFIG.php to point to your database
3. The /audio/ folder must exist and be writable. 
3. Some provided functions may already exist if you are combining this with the "image app" code.  Delete these individual functions if they cause duplicate function definitions. 
4. The provided CSS just for demo purposes. It is not important to the functionality of these files.
